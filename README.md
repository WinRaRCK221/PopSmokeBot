# PopSmokeBot

PopSmokeBot is a discord application that uses mp3 files of a collection of songs by the artist Pop Smoke and concatenates those files into random 10 second snippets using Fluent - FFMPEG JS library. The command /pop is used to trigger the discord command file for /pop and create a request in which the audio.js file is called to get a random song and concatenate a 10 second snippet. Lastly the audio.js exports the function back into discord.
